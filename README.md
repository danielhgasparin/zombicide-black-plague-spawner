# zombicide-black-plague-spawner
A web app to speed up the spawn step in a Zombicide Black Plague game.

Build with:

```
docker run --rm -i -t -v (pwd):/code node:0.10.38-wheezy bash -c "cd /code; npm i; npm run build"
```

The `dist/` directory is the compiled output, but it's committed here because it's kind of a pain to rebuild.
